remote 1.3.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

new features:
  * readEot: import previously created EOT* files back into R. For that purpose, 
    file 'remote_eot_locations.csv' (created from functions eot() or writeEot()) 
    now includes pixel IDs of all leading modes.
  * predict: included a proper 'filename' argument in addition to '...', thus 
    allowing the user to specify further arguments passed to calc() and, at the 
    same time, enabling layer-by-layer storage of the resulting Raster* images.

bugfixes:
  * fixed warning message related to missing 'expl.var' object. 
  * minor documentation updates.
